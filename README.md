# Python Basics
A few basic Python programs. You can download the code and run it on your local system if it has a Python interpreter or use an online interpreter.

Enjoy...

> P.S, for insight into a different way of implementing these programs, refer to this fantastic repo, [Python-Application-Programming](https://github.com/Eloquencere/Python-Application-Programming) by my good friend [Eloquencere](https://github.com/Eloquencere).
