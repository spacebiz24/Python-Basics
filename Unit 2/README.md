___

Programs:
1. Design and implement a python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given string. If the string length is less than 2 return instead the empty string.
1. Design and implement a python program to count the number 4 in a given list.
1. Design and implement a python program to generate and print list except the first 5 elements, where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 30(both included).
1. Design and implement a python function that takes two lists and returns true if they have at least one common.
1. Design and implement a python program to find the list of words that are no longer than n from a given list of words.
1. Design and implement a program to count the number of vowels present in a given list of strings using ‘in’ or ‘not in’ operator.
1. Write a function char_freq() that takes a string and builds a frequency listing of the characters contained in it. Represent the frequency listing as a python dictionary.
1. Write a function called dict_intersect that takes two dictionaries as arguments and returns a dictionary that contains only the key/value pairs found in both of the original dictionaries.
1. Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list.
1. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters. 
Sample String : 'The quick Brown Fox'
Expected Output : 
No. of Upper case characters : 3
No. of Lower case Characters : 13
1. Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not.
1. Write a Python program to check whether a list contains a sublist.
1. Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the keys only.
1. Write a program which count and print the numbers of each character in a string input by console.
Example:
If the following string is given as input to the program:
abcdeabc
Then, the output of the program should be:
a,2   c,2   b,2   e,1   d,1
1. Write a program to generate and print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).
1. Write a function called count_values that takes a single dictionary as an argument and returns the number of distinct values it contains. Given the input {‘red’:1,’green’:1,’blue’:2}, for example it should return 2.
1. Write a Python program to generate and print a list except for the first 5 elements, where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 30 (both included)
1. Write a Python Program using function to Sort Words in Alphabetic Order
1. Write a program to read details of the student(name as string ,usn as int ,semester as int) in comma separated values from the keyboard and split & typecast the input based on comma delimiter and store it in list before displaying it.
